# 1. Introduction

This is a review and critique of the paper "Overdose in Illicit Opioids: The Role of Heroin Legal Status" using a causal inference pipeline. We analyze the methods used in the paper, critique them from a causal perspective, propose ways to strengthen the study, and suggest potential extensions.

The paper examines whether a change in the legal status of heroin would significantly affect overdose rates. Though the study contributes interesting observations, its methodology and execution require more rigor from a causal perspective.

# 2. Pre-Analysis: Estimands, Data, and Data Generation Process

Before delving into the methods and critique, we define the estimands, consider the data and its generation process, and outline an identification strategy.

## 2.1 What is the Estimand?

In this case, the paper aimed to estimate the causal effect of heroin's legal status on overdose rates. Potential research questions could be:

-   Is there a difference in overdose rates between jurisdictions where heroin is illegal and where it's legalized or decriminalized?
-   If heroin's legal status changed, what would be the expected change in overdose rates?

## 2.2 Thinking About the Data

The data used in the paper is observational and presents data on opioid prescription rates, non-medical use rates, emergency room visit rates, and overdose deaths. When thinking about data, it's important to consider how it was gathered and what inherent biases it might contain. The paper utilizes data from various studies examining overdose rates related to heroin and other opioid use. The authors also consider the recent epidemic of prescription opioid use in the United States as a natural experiment. Some variables to be considered here are the legal status of opioids, variations in illicit drug purity, the presence of drug contaminants, prescription opioid dependence, and overdose fatalities.

## 2.3 Contemplating the Data Generation Process

Understanding the data generation process is key. In this case, a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) shows the relationships between opioid use, overdose rates, and various confounding factors, including socio-economic factors, access to medical treatment, and drug potency.

# 3. Methods and Approach: Review and Critique

The paper fundamentally challenges two prevalent assumptions that underlie our understanding of opioid overdose, which are that illicit drug purity variations and drug contaminants significantly contribute to overdoses. In attempting to critique these beliefs, the authors explore existing demographic, toxicological, and epidemiological data related to heroin overdoses.

Their approach relies heavily on cases of Drug Induced Deaths (DID) and overdoses, which may not present a complete representation of the target population. This reliance on extreme scenarios could potentially lead to biased estimates as it overlooks the spectrum of drug usage patterns and associated risks.

The intriguing aspect of their approach is the leveraging of the prescription opioid epidemic as a natural experiment. This strategy allows the researchers to observe the impact of a significant shift in access to legally prescribed, known, and pure opioids and its correlation with overdose rates. As the epidemic unfolded, prescription rates for opioids increased, and counterintuitively, so did overdose deaths. These findings suggest that making opioids legally accessible does not necessarily mitigate the risk of overdoses, challenging the two assumptions.

However, the comparison made between prescription opioids and heroin is potentially flawed. While the authors argue that known dose and purity do not protect users from overdoses, they fail to convincingly transfer these findings from prescription opioids to the context of heroin use, which is often characterized by different user profiles and usage patterns.

## 3.1 Confounders, Colliders, Mediators

Despite the compelling use of the opioid epidemic as a natural experiment, the analysis doesn't fully consider potential confounders, colliders, or mediators. For instance, socio-economic factors could influence both drug usage patterns and access to treatment, thus confounding the relationship between opioid legality and overdose rates. Polydrug use is another potential confounder that isn't adequately addressed. Simultaneous use of CNS depressants, such as alcohol and benzodiazepines, along with opioids, could significantly impact overdose rates.

Moreover, there is insufficient analysis of the complex relationships between various risk factors, such as individual and social environment factors, which influence tolerance and thus, the effect of drug purity on overdose risk.

## 3.2 Lack of Randomization

The paper predominantly relies on observational data from the natural experiment, which inherently lacks the randomization found in experimental studies. While the natural experiment provides valuable insights, the non-random nature of the observed data could expose the results to potential bias or confounding factors.

## 3.3 Absence of Counterfactual

A significant limitation in the study is the lack of a clear counterfactual scenario. In other words, it's not explicit what would have happened to overdose rates if the prescription opioid epidemic hadn't occurred. In other words, it's not explicit what would have happened to overdose rates if the prescription opioid epidemic hadn't occurred. Such a counterfactual analysis is vital for attributing causality in the context of natural experiments.

## 3.4 Issues with Extrapolation

The authors make a leap in extrapolating from the effects of legalized pharmaceutical opioids to those of legalized heroin. However, the transferability of effects between these two opioids is not sufficiently substantiated, potentially leading to faulty conclusions. However, the transferability of effects between these two opioids is not sufficiently substantiated, potentially leading to faulty conclusions. Also, they propose to provide injectable heroin in treatment settings as a solution, which contradicts their original premise of treating all opioids similarly for their natural experiment.

# 4. Proposed Remedies

## 4.1 Use of Quasi-Experimental Methods

To strengthen their analysis, the authors could employ quasi-experimental methods that exploit natural variations in policy or exposure to opioids, much like their current approach, but with a stronger focus on controlling for confounding variables. Furthermore, using alternative data sources or methods could offer a more representative sample of the target population. Furthermore, using alternative data sources or methods could offer a more representative sample of the target population.

## 4.2 Counterfactual Scenario Analysis

A detailed counterfactual scenario analysis could enrich the study. This might involve creating hypothetical scenarios using data from jurisdictions where heroin has been legalized or decriminalized, offering a more concrete basis for the argument.

# 5. Extension of Research

## 5.1 Multi-Dimensional Approach

Future research could extend this work by considering not only the legal status of heroin but also variables such as access to healthcare, the potency of the drugs being used, the prevalence of polydrug use, and socio-economic factors. This would require the inclusion of more detailed individual and contextual variables in the analysis to better capture the complexity of heroin use patterns and associated risks.

## 5.2 Use of Causal Models

Employing causal models, such as Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), could further enhance the analysis. Such models could help to delineate the assumed causal relationships more clearly and identify potential confounders and mediators in the process.

# 6. Evaluate

Finally, an evaluation of the robustness of the results obtained would be crucial. Sensitivity analysis could be conducted to assess the impact of potential confounding variables and offer insights into how resilient the conclusions are under different assumptions. Given the complexity of the issue, a robust sensitivity analysis could provide further confidence in the findings or expose areas for further inquiry.

Moreover, the proposed provision of injectable heroin in treatment settings warrants rigorous testing to evaluate its effectiveness. The potential for adverse reactions and the logistical and ethical challenges of implementing such an approach must be carefully considered.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, the paper offers a thought-provoking analysis of the relationship between the legal status of heroin and overdose rates. By challenging conventional assumptions and leveraging the prescription opioid epidemic as a natural experiment, it invites readers to reconsider commonly held beliefs about the opioid crisis.

However, there are several areas in which the research could be improved. Primarily, there is a need for a more rigorous treatment of potential confounders, colliders, and mediators in the analysis. Additionally, an explicit effect identification strategy could further strengthen the paper's causal inferences.

The lack of randomization inherent in the observational data used and the absence of a clear counterfactual scenario are other limitations that need addressing. The extrapolation of the effects of legal pharmaceutical opioids to the potential effects of legalized heroin also raises some concerns.

Despite these limitations, the paper contributes significantly to the discourse on the opioid crisis. Going forward, applying quasi-experimental methods, conducting counterfactual scenario analysis, and utilizing causal models like Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) can help enhance our understanding of this complex issue.

Finally, the sensitivity analysis of the results could provide invaluable insights into the robustness of the study's conclusions, allowing us to understand better the effects of potential changes in heroin's legal status on overdose rates. Additionally, careful consideration and rigorous testing of proposed interventions, like providing injectable heroin in treatment settings, are critical to inform effective, evidence-based policies.

The paper prompts us to delve deeper into the multifaceted issue of opioid overdoses and to approach the crisis from a more nuanced perspective. Its findings underscore the importance of rigorous, comprehensive research in informing effective, evidence-based policies in tackling the opioid crisis.
